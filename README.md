Instrumented City is a concept for a combined wireless access and sensor network by [Commotion Wireless](https://commotionwireless.net) and [Throneless Tech](https://throneless.tech).

The Instrumented City is a fully distributed, secure sensor and connectivity platform. An Instrumented City node is an inexpensive multi-radio device running open-source software. Each node is designed to connect to every other node via common radio protocols such as Wi-Fi, Zigbee, LoRa or other technologies.

It is intended to create an easy to use platform for organizations and individuals to contribute and utilize data, thereby connecting communities to environmental and sensor data that was previously unaccessible. This can augment both environmental justice work, and existing community networking efforts, since it brings additional value when constructing networks and building partnerships.
